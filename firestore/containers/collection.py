    John Cleese (Commentator): Vivian Smith-Smythe-Smith has an O-level
        in chemo-hygiene. Simon-Zinc-Trumpet-Harris, married to a very
        attractive table lamp. Nigel Incubator-Jones, his best friend is a tree,
        and in his spare time he's a stockbroker. Gervaise Brook-Hampster is in
        the Guards, and his father uses him as a wastepaper basket.
        And finally Oliver St John-Mollusc, Harrow and the Guards, thought
        by many to be this year's outstanding twit. Now they're moving
        up to the starting line, there's a jolly good crowd here today.
        Now they're under starter's orders ... and they're off!
