Reporting issues
----------------

- If you can please check if such an issue has already been reported.
- Provide your Python / Firestore version
- Kindly provide a detailed description of what you expected to happen.
- Describe what happened instead. Include a full traceback if there was
  an exception.
- The best way to help us easily identify the issue is to include a `reprex`_
  or `minimal reproducible example`_. This will also help to ensure
  that the issue is not from your own codebase.
